//function notes

//functions are all about the input and output, like a machine that you input raw material in and then it outputs the finished product
//calculators, good example
//and example of an input could be an array or object, strings
//can a function can produce multiple outputs? - yes ex: return array
//return can be put anywhere in your code but can only return ONE value
//however combined with an array, return can bring back multiple values in an array format
//ex: return [3, 4, 6, 7, 1]
//the return function causes the function to stop and then "return" that value
//
// Let VS const
// let as a keywork allows for reassigning of a variable, the varriable is maleable, it can change
// let is good for values that constantly change within things like functions such as numerical values
//const by constrast can not change as it is a CONSTANT variable, and can never change
//const is good for defining things like arrays or objects or inline functions, things that dont need and should never change under normal conditions
